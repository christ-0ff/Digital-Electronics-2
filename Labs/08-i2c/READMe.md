### Arduino Uno pinout

1. In the picture of the Arduino Uno board, there are marked pins that can be used for the following functions:
   * PWM generators from Timer0, Timer1, Timer2
   * analog channels for ADC
   * UART pins
   * I2C pins
   * SPI pins
   * external interrupt pins INT0, INT1

### I2C

1. Code listing of Timer1 overflow interrupt service routine for scanning I2C devices and rendering a clear table on the UART:

```c
/* Interrupt service routines ----------------------------------------*/
/**********************************************************************
 * Function: Timer/Counter1 overflow interrupt
 * Purpose:  Update Finite State Machine and test I2C slave addresses 
 *           between 8 and 119.
 **********************************************************************/
ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)
{
    static state_t state = STATE_IDLE;  // Current state of the FSM
    static uint8_t addr = 7;            // I2C slave address
    uint8_t result = 1;                 // ACK result from the bus
    char uart_string[2] = "00";         // String for converting numbers by itoa()

    // FSM
    switch (state)
    {
    // Increment I2C slave address
    case STATE_IDLE:
        addr++;
        
        // If slave address is between 8 and 119 then move to SEND state
        if (addr >= 8 && addr <= 119)
        {
            state = STATE_SEND;
        }
        else
        {
            addr = 7;
        }
        break;
    
    // Transmit I2C slave address and get result
    case STATE_SEND:
        // I2C address frame:
        // +------------------------+------------+
        // |      from Master       | from Slave |
        // +------------------------+------------+
        // | 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 |     ACK    |
        // |a6 a5 a4 a3 a2 a1 a0 R/W|   result   |
        // +------------------------+------------+
        result = twi_start((addr<<1) + TWI_WRITE);
        twi_stop();
        
        /* Test result from I2C bus. If it is 0 then move to ACK state, 
        /* otherwise move to IDLE */
        if (!result)
        {
            state = STATE_ACK;
        }
        else
        {
            state = STATE_IDLE; 
        }
        break;

    // A module connected to the bus was found
    case STATE_ACK:
        // Send info about active I2C slave to UART and move to IDLE
        itoa(addr, uart_string, 10);
        uart_puts(uart_string);
        uart_puts("\r\n");
        state = STATE_IDLE;
        break;

    // If something unexpected happens then move to IDLE
    default:
        state = STATE_IDLE;
        break;
    }
}

```

2. (Hand-drawn) picture of I2C signals when reading checksum (only 1 byte) from DHT12 sensor. Indication of which specific moments control the data line master and which slave.

   ![yor figure](images/i2c.png)

* Start & Stop done by master.
* Master always sends slave address to slave as well as R/W condition. 
* All ACK/NACK is set by slave.
* "Some Checksum Data" sends slave to master.


### Meteo station

Consideration of an application for temperature and humidity measurement and display. Used combine sensor DHT12, real time clock DS3231, LCD, and one LED. Application display time in hours:minutes:seconds at LCD, measures both temperature and humidity values once per minut, display both values on LCD, and when the temperature is too high, the LED starts blinking.
